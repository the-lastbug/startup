# STARTUP
The files you've provided create a simple **Startup Directory** web page.

* The **`index.html`** file sets up the structure of the page, including a header, a search bar, a section for displaying startup cards, and a form to submit new startups.
* The **`style.css`** file handles the visual design, applying a colorful gradient background and styling the search bar, the interactive startup cards, and the submission form. It also includes animations for when the cards load.
* The **`script.js`** file provides the interactive functionality. It allows users to search for startups by filtering the displayed cards and adds new startup entries to the directory when the form is submitted.

# STARTUP
This project is a simple, single-page web application for a startup directory. The **HTML** provides the page's structure, including a search bar and a form. **CSS** styles the layout with a responsive card-based design and animations. **JavaScript** adds functionality, enabling a live search and dynamic addition of new startups via the form.

* The **`index.html`** file sets up the structure of the page, including a header, a search bar, a section for displaying startup cards, and a form to submit new startups.
* The **`style.css`** file handles the visual design, applying a colorful gradient background and styling the search bar, the interactive startup cards, and the submission form. It also includes animations for when the cards load.
* The **`script.js`** file provides the interactive functionality. It allows users to search for startups by filtering the displayed cards and adds new startup entries to the directory when the form is submitted.
